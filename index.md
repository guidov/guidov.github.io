I specialize in using traditional climate models for research which couple variour components of the Earth System together, but which require large computational resources to integrate the time evolution of the complex high-dimensional systems. 

In recent years, I've become increasingly interested in the application of machine learning to climate science and large language models to enhance scientific data analysis.
