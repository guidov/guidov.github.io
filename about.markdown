# About Me

Hello! I like exploring new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others.
I'm a researcher that specialized in Earth System physics and climate science. My work focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of our planet's climate system, from fundamental physical processes to cutting-edge technologies that help us unravel its mysteries. I am transitioning out of academia for the time being.

## My Background

I have a diverse background in physics and computer science. My interests include:

- Data Science
- Open Source Software

## My Goals

I created this blog to share my experiences, insights, and as an attempt to record my software configurations.
I work mostly in Ubuntu linux and WSL(Ubuntu) on Windows 11.

## My Expertise

- **Earth Physics**: I have a deep understanding of the physical processes that shape our planet, climate dynamics, climate systems, and geophysical phenomena.
- **Climate Science**: I specialize in the study of Earth's climate, with a focus on the impact of human activities and the role of data analysis and modeling in climate research.
- **Machine Learning**: I am learning about the applications of ML in Earth sciences, such as weather forecasting, natural disaster prediction, bias correction and environmental monitoring.
