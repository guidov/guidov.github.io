Summary

This research investigates the Dansgaard–Oeschger (D–O) oscillation, a millennial-scale climate pattern that occurred during the last glacial period. The study uses Earth system model simulations to show that the D–O oscillation was controlled by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The models demonstrate that within a specific range of CO2 levels (~190–225 parts per million), the climate system exhibits spontaneous oscillations between cold stadial and warm interstadial states. Outside this range, the system remains in either a stable cold or warm state. The authors propose a new theoretical framework for explaining the D–O oscillation, based on a slow–fast dynamical system model. This framework suggests that the oscillation is driven by a complex interplay between the ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice, with CO2 acting as a control parameter. The study also explores the effects of Heinrich events, which are massive iceberg discharges from ice sheets, on the D–O oscillation. They find that Heinrich events can trigger abrupt transitions to interstadial states but are not essential for the long-term operation of the oscillation. The research provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of glacial climate variability and highlights the importance of CO2 in regulating these fluctuations.

# FAQ: Atmospheric CO2 Control of Spontaneous Millennial-Scale Ice Age Climate Oscillations

## 1. What are Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, and what characterizes them?

Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events are millennial-scale climate oscillations that occurred during glacial periods. They are characterized by abrupt shifts between cold stadial and warm interstadial states. In the Northern Hemisphere, these temperature swings could be as large as 16°C. The Southern Hemisphere experienced a smaller-amplitude counterpart with an opposing pattern. While the exact causes are debated, changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a crucial ocean current system, are thought to be a key driver.

## 2. How does atmospheric CO2 influence D-O events?

Atmospheric CO2 acts as a control knob for D-O events. Research using the CCSM4 climate model shows that within a specific CO2 window (roughly 190-225 parts per million), the climate system spontaneously oscillates between stadial and interstadial states. Outside this range, the climate remains locked in either a cold, low-CO2 state or a warm, high-CO2 state, with transitions occurring less frequently and more randomly due to internal climate variability.

## 3. What mechanisms drive D-O oscillations within the CO2 window?

Within the CO2 window, a complex interplay between atmospheric CO2, ocean circulation, and sea ice dictates the timing and characteristics of D-O oscillations. High CO2 levels generally lead to longer interstadials and shorter stadials. This is because high CO2 leads to warmer temperatures and reduced sea ice in the North Atlantic, favouring a strong AMOC. Conversely, low CO2 promotes colder conditions, expanded sea ice, and a weaker AMOC, resulting in longer stadials.

## 4. What role does the AMOC play in D-O events?

The AMOC plays a critical role in D-O oscillations. A strong AMOC brings warm, salty water northward, leading to warmer temperatures in the North Atlantic region and a warmer Greenland. Conversely, a weakened or collapsed AMOC results in colder conditions in the North Atlantic and allows for the expansion of sea ice southward, triggering a transition to a stadial state.

## 5. How do Heinrich events, massive iceberg discharges, impact the system?

Heinrich events act as perturbations to the D-O cycle. Climate model simulations show that freshwater input from melting icebergs can prolong stadial periods and, in some cases, lead to a more pronounced overshoot of AMOC strength during the subsequent interstadial. This overshoot occurs because the system has to traverse a greater distance in the "phase space" (representing the state of the climate system) to return to a warm state.

## 6. What is the significance of the "slow-fast" dynamical system framework?

The D-O cycle can be conceptualized as a "slow-fast" dynamical system. The slow component is represented by gradual changes in ocean buoyancy due to factors like heat and freshwater fluxes. The fast component reflects the AMOC's relatively rapid response to these changes. The interplay of these slow and fast processes, modulated by CO2, gives rise to the characteristic oscillations.

## 7. What are the limitations of current research on D-O events?

Current understanding of D-O events relies on models with a simplified representation of the climate system. Future research needs to incorporate the influence of other Earth system components, such as ice sheet dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, and external forcings like solar variability, to develop a truly comprehensive theory.

## 8. Why is understanding D-O events important today?

Understanding past climate variability, including abrupt shifts like D-O events, is crucial for comprehending the complexities of the climate system and improving projections of future climate change, particularly in the context of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

**Main Theme:** This study investigates the role of atmospheric CO2 levels in driving the Dansgaard–Oeschger (D–O) oscillations, rapid climate shifts between cold stadial and warm interstadial states, during the last glacial period (Marine Isotope Stage 3, MIS 3).

**Key Findings:**

1. **CO2 as a Control Knob:** The study identifies a "D–O window" of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (approximately 190–225 parts per million) within which spontaneous, self-sustained D–O oscillations emerge in the climate model. Outside this window, the system settles into either a stable cold state (low CO2) or a stable warm state (high CO2).
2. **Internal Climate Oscillator:** The authors propose the existence of an internal stochastic climate oscillator, intrinsically linked to CO2 levels. This oscillator operates based on the interplay between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation, influenced by sea ice, ocean salinity, and heat content.
3. “Agreement between observations and the hierarchically disparate models suggests the existence of an internal stochastic climate oscillator, which tracks variations in atmospheric CO2 level through the glacial, acting in concert with noise-induced transitions.”
4. **Mechanism of Oscillation:** Atmospheric CO2 modulates the rate at which key processes within the D–O cycle operate. For example, higher CO2 levels lead to faster North Atlantic sea-ice loss and enhanced salt advection feedback, shortening the stadial period. Conversely, lower CO2 favors longer stadial periods.
5. "The CO2 control parameter impacts the salinity convergence in the North Atlantic, which affects the rate of salt advection feedback in each simulation, a critical component in terminating the stadial climate state."
6. **Role of Heinrich Events:** While not essential for the oscillations themselves, Heinrich events (massive iceberg discharges) can perturb the system's trajectory within the phase space defined by AMOC and AABW strength. This perturbation can result in a more pronounced AMOC recovery following a Heinrich stadial.
7. **Towards a Comprehensive Theory:** The authors acknowledge that other factors, such as ice sheet dynamics, freshwater transport, and orbital forcing, can also influence the D–O cycle. Further research is needed to fully understand the interplay of these mechanisms.

**Important Considerations:**

- The study relies on a specific climate model (CCSM4) with a modified ocean mixing parameterization.
- The model uses a simplified representation of ice sheet configurations during MIS 3.
- The authors acknowledge the need to investigate biases in different Earth system models to better constrain the D–O window.

**Overall, this study provides compelling evidence for the significant role of atmospheric CO2 levels in driving spontaneous D–O oscillations during glacial periods. The findings contribute valuable insights into the complex interplay of mechanisms driving abrupt climate changes.**
