1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the AppImage.
    
2. Make the AppImage executable:
    
    ```shell
    chmod +x cursor-0.40.4x86_64.AppImage
    ```
    
3. Create a new directory to extract the content:
    
    ```shell
    mkdir ~/cursor-extracted
    ```
    
4. Extract the contents of the AppImage:
    
    ```shell
    ./cursor-0.40.4x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
    ```
    
5. Move the extracted content to the new directory:
    
    ```shell
    mv squashfs-root/* ~/cursor-extracted/
    ```
    
6. Create a startup script for Cursor:
    
    ```shell
    cat << EOF > ~/run-cursor.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    export TMPDIR=\$HOME/cursor-temp
    mkdir -p \$TMPDIR
    cd ~/cursor-extracted
    ./AppRun "\$@"
    EOF
    ```
    

This script sets up a custom temporary directory to avoid permission issues.

7. Make the script executable:
    
    ```shell
    chmod +x ~/run-cursor.sh
    ```
    
8. Run Cursor using the new script:
    
    ```shell
    ~/run-cursor.sh
    ```

also it was remarked


sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/share/code
