```
[wsl2]
vmIdleTimeout=-1
```

in %userprofile%/.wslconfig

I actually now found a command that starts WSL 2 VM, exits, and WSL 2 VM and instance are left running:

This next command keeps it running in the background
```
wsl --exec dbus-launch true && wsl
```

May need to run docker on windows to keep alive

This below seems to work.
Run this vbs script on windows startup. Just put it in the windows startup folder (crl+r ->Â `shell:startup`)

wsl-startup.vbs:

```# change '<Distro>' to the distro name you are using.
set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
ws.Run "wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04", 0, True
```
or put it here:
brita ralph@ARTY C:\Users\Brita Ralph\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup>more wsl-startup.vbs
set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
ws.Run "wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04", 0, True


or this from another user:
```
```
Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
objShell.Run "wsl.exe --distribution Ubuntu-24.04 --exec dbus-launch true", 0, True
objShell.Run "wsl.exe --distribution Ubuntu-24.04", 1, True
```

I also tried this as a startup file, but I don't know if works as well:
@echo off
echo "Starting Ubuntu..."
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u root service dbus start

REM Wait a bit to ensure WSL starts properly
timeout /t 5

echo "Mounting drive..."
%powershell -Command "Start-Process wsl -ArgumentList '--mount \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive2 --partition 1' -Verb runAs"
wsl --mount \.\\PhysicalDrive2 --partition 1
echo "Done"
